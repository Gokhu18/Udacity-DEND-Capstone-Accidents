## Udacity-DEND-Capstone-Accidents
Code for final capstone project for Udacity Data Engineering Nano Degree

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a data model and ETL flow to be able to provide analytical capability for analysing traffic accidents. The outcome of the analysis will provide insights to what conditions may cause maximum accidents and what steps can be taken to minimize such incidents. The data spans across multiple years and has close to 3 million rows.

## Datasource Details:
The data is gathered from Kaggle and below are the details.
* US Accidents from Feb 2016 to Dec 2019. [US_Accidents_Dec19.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
* Washington DC taxi cab trips for 2017. [taxi_final.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/bvc5283/dc-taxi-trips)

## Supporting Datasets:
List of US airport codes is are got through 2 websites as below-
* List of US State Codes [US State Codes](https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/states_csv)
